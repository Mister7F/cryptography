# Cryptography

I developed many cryptographic algorithms in C++, from scratch.
- AES (standard implementation and a very fast implementation with 32 bits looking table)
- Padding Oracle Attack
- SHA-1
- SHA-2
- TOTP code generation

Please **DO NOT USE** this code in production, it might be vulnerable to side channel attack. Instead, you might want to use OpenSSL. The goal of this repo is just to learn how work those algorithms, at low level.
